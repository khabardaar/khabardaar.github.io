<p>We begin with Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar, remembering Salil Chowdhury and his music. In Filmi Khabrein we talk about three leading ladies in Hindi cinema today, and their upcoming projects - Sonam Kapoor, Taapsee Pannu and Jahnvi Kapoor.</p>

<p>In Bollywood Behes we remember 70&rsquo;s actress Vidya Sinha. The news of her demise last month caught everyone by surprise. Aparita had recently watched Rajnigandha on the big screen in Toronto, and had been reminiscing about Basu Chatterjee&rsquo;s &lsquo;middle cinema&rsquo; with Baisakhi. We look back at the modern heroine as represented by Sinha in movies such as Rajnigandha (1974) and Chhoti Si Baat (1975), whose life seemed to mirror that of the viewer.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 58: In this episode, a look at how Kashmir has been portrayed in Bollywood and Hindi films over the years.</p>

<p>We begin with Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar, paying tribute to older movies set in Kashmir, as well as veteran star Vidya Sinha. Filmi Khabrein returns, in which we talk about Akshay Kumar and other Bollywood celebrities. And then Bollywood Behes takes us into Kashmir, as seen in Hindi cinema.</p>

<p>Given the current political climate, we take a look at the way this disputed territory - one of the world&rsquo;s most militarized zones - has been portrayed as a honeymoon or holiday destination in older Bollywood movies. With movies like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZJwcbCuOlc">Roja</a>, terrorism became another backdrop to set Hindi films against. More recent films such as <a href="https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/70153553">Harud</a> and <a href="https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/70303432">Haider</a>, however, have given us a sense of life under military seige.</p>

The Hindi remake of the Telugu sleeper hit Arjun Reddy is a bonafide Bollywood blockbuster. We try to understand why this misogynist film has struck a chord with viewers.</p>

<p>We start off with Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar remembering two unique Hindi song takes on the idea of love &ndash; Dil Chahta Hai&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jaane Kyun&rdquo; and &ldquo;Man Kyun Behka&rdquo; from Utsav.</p>

<p>Filmi Khabrein covers the latest in Bollywood news, including an update on Vicky Kaushal&rsquo;s latest army look.</p>

<p>In Bollywood Behes, we revisit some themes we had already elaborated on while discussing Arjun Reddy. We talk about the difference between self-destructive obsession and love &ndash; no matter how intense. However, the movie has broken box-office records. So what do we take away from it all?

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 52: In this episode, we pay tribute to veteran playwright, actor, writer and thinker <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48580607">Girish Karnad</a> - who played a starring role both in art house and commercial Hindi/Indian cinema</p>

<p>We start off with Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar featuring two songs to remember Karnad by: a Kannada bhava-geethe Deepavu Ninnade Gaaliyu Ninnade and Mero Gaam Katha Parey. Filmi Khabrein follows, featuring news from the South Indian film industries.</p>

<p>In Bollywood Behes, we look at the important legacy that Karnad has left in Kannada literature and films, as well as his many artistic contributions to Hindi cinema. He worked behind the scenes as a screenwriter for Shyam Benegal films such as Bhumika and Godhuli. He also shone in front of the camera in films such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEZMvixYP7w">Nishant</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91qliAxU1pA">Manthan</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HsRQh8sNkU">Swami</a> as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmUl0l8qBXw">Ek Tha Tiger</a>. And then there was his role as the father in the TV series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEjfHV0YbII">Malgudi Days</a>. Karnad brought an artistic sensitivity that often didn&rsquo;t need words to be expressed.</p>

<p>Rafi (Siddiqui) is a street photographer who happens to take a photograph of Miloni (Malhotra) in front of the famous Mumbai tourist spot Gateway of India. Tired of his grandmother&rsquo;s constant refrain to get married, Rafi sends Miloni&rsquo;s photograph to his grandmother saying he&rsquo;s found a girl to marry. When the grandmother announces she&rsquo;s coming to Mumbai to meet the girl, Rafi needs to convince Miloni to play along.</p>

<p>Before we focus on Photograph in Bollywood Behes, we revisit two Mumbai-set songs in Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar and tune into news from the Hindi film industry in Filmi Khabrein.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 49: In this episode, we unpack our feelings about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4Z_ueeT_XQ">Kalank</a>, the multi-starrer film featuring Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan, Aditya Roy Kapur, Sonakshi Sinha, Madhuri Dixit and Sanjay Dutt among others.</p>

<p>Set against the backdrop of the Partition of India and Pakistan, Kalank attempts to tell the story of love, betrayal and loss. The elaborate family saga starts with Satya (Sonakshi Sinha), who in the face of imminent death due to a disease, persuades Roop (Alia Bhatt) to marry her husband Dev (Aditya Roy Kapur). Stuck in a loveless marriage, Roop finds herself drawn to Zafar (Varun Dhawan), a blacksmith, who has his own agenda in charming Roop. Turns out that this love quandary is actually the result of an older love story that went awry. How will Roop, Dev and Zafar fare?</p>

<p>We begin the show with Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar featuring two &lsquo;kotha&rsquo; classic songs: Salaam-E-Ishq from Muqaddar Ka Siqander and Tharhe Rahio from Pakeezah. Then we check in with some Filmi Khabrein, where we talk about the upcoming <a href="https://www.iffsatoronto.com/">IFFSA Toronto</a> among other news items, before diving into Bollywood Behes.</p>

<p>Super Deluxe features four separate stories (we mistakenly counted three in our discussion, skipping the story of Leela and Arputham) that come together to form a larger narrative questioning issues such as sexuality, religion, caste and gender - while being both deeply philosophical and irreverent.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 47: In this episode, a look at Govind Nihalani&rsquo;s cult classic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1sQcEWlI2Q">Party</a>, starring an ensemble cast of some the best Indian theatre and art-house actors such as Deepa Sahi, Manohar Singh and Rohini Hattangadi.</p>

<p>The premise of the film is deceptively simple. A celebrated playwright Diwakar Barve (Manohar Singh) has been awarded a prestigious literary award. Socialite Damayanti Rane (Vijaya Mehta) organizes a party to celebrate Barve. A room full of intellectuals soon assemble together, but their conversations mainly centre around missing poet-turned-activist Amrit (Naseeruddin Shah). Over the evening, the gathering discusses the role of art in society, while pointing out each other&rsquo;s - or their own - hypocrisy.</p>

<p>First we start off with Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar, a shaadi special featuring some unusual shaadi-waali movies - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZlIWvEmx3s">Saathiya</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc0Kr9JEVXs">Tanu Weds Manu</a>.</p>

<p>Then Bollywood Behes takes us into the world of modern day Indian weddings. Dreamed up by Reema Kagti and Zoya Akhtar, this series focuses on the complicated lives of two wedding planners Tara and Karan, and the couples they are planning weddings for. Issues such as dowry, class, tradition, as well as LGBTQ lives are seen through a not-so-rosy lens.</p>

Rai extravaganza starring Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, alongside top-billing female leads Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif. The movie didn&rsquo;t impress us much; but then neither did Race 3 or Thugs of Hindostan earlier in 2018.  So, this episode features our experience of watching Zero, followed by a discussion on the relevance of Bollywood&rsquo;s Khan triumverate.</p>

<p>We start off with Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar, followed by Filmi Khabrein - where we note the passing of two Indian cinema greats: veteran art house filmmaker Mrinal Sen, and Bollywood screenwriter and actor Kader Khan.</p>

<p>We also meet two Shah Rukh fans who run SRK Universe Canada, the Canadian chapter of an international fan forum, and pay a short tribute to Kader Khan.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 37: In this special episode, a conversation with celebrated Indian documentary filmmaker Anand Patwardhan about his latest work Vivek/Reason.</p>

<p>Vivek/Reason screened as part of the Toronto International Film Festival (2018). Although many balked at first at its run-time &ndash; the 261 minute long documentary is meant to be screened in two sessions &ndash; critics noted its importance, especially given the rise of nationalistic rhetoric in India and across the world. The incidents shown in Vivek might not be new, but the way it connects the dots between seemingly disparate incidents gives much needed context to the rise of Hindu extremism.</p>

This horror-comedy film starring Rajkummar Rao, Shraddha Kapoor, Aparshakti Khurrana, Abhishek Banerjee and Pankaj Tripathi was a sleeper hit, telling an unusual story of an evil female spirit who kidnaps men.</p>

<p>Although the film used the horror-comedy genre to address themes such as patriarchy and consent in an amusing and innovative fashion &ndash; stale jokes, lazy writing and a meandering script watered down its central thesis.</p>

<p>This discussion comes after a round of Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar featuring two golden oldies Hindi tunes, and a Filmi Khabrein round-up of the latest Bollywood news.</p>

<p>While romance is always an ingredient in popular Hindi films, Bollywood romcoms are a genre unto themselves. Contemporary Hindi cinema has given us plenty of movies to choose from, even if the gender politics remain somewhat problematic. While we now see more self-assured female leads, will Bollywood give us a sensitive male character like Peter Kavinsky? These are all points we consider, after a round of Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar featuring two remix songs and the latest news from the Hindi film industry in Filmi Khabrein.</p>

Well-versed with Manto&rsquo;s prolific writings, Wajeeh was disappointed with what he saw as the film&rsquo;s mischaracterization of the celebrated Urdu writer Manto. If you want to know more about Manto, <a href="http://thewirehindi.com/58457/saadat-hasan-manto-nandita-das-nawazuddin-siddiqui/">says Wajeeh</a>, just read his many stories and essays.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 25: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz_6jwUGLGk">Karwaan</a> is an offbeat addition to Bollywood&rsquo;s genre of road trip movies. Starring Dulquer Salmaan, Irrfan Khan and Mithila Palkar, it follows the unusual friendship that evolves between three seemingly disconnected people.</p>

<p>To please his father, Avinash (Dulquer) keeps working a soulless job, although he&rsquo;d much rather pursue his passion for photography. An unexpected phone call informs him of his father&rsquo;s death in a bus accident and sets the road trip in motion. Avinash enlists his friend Shaukat (Irrfan), who owns a van, to collect his father&rsquo;s body, and discovers a case of mistaken dead bodies. A series of strange circumstances, full of dark humour, requires them to pick up a third passenger Tanya (Mithila) enroute their final destinations.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 22: Netflix India original series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28j8h0RRov4">Sacred Games</a> has been getting lots of acclaim from critics and audiences alike. Starring Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Saif Ali Khan in main roles, alongside a stellar supporting cast, it is directed by Hindi cinema heavyweights Vikramaditya Motwane and Anurag Kashyap.</p>

<p>Sacred Games is adapted from Vikram Chandra&rsquo;s 2006 novel, a 900-page tome. The series stays true to the spirit of the novel, which takes us into the labyrinthine depths of Mumbai, where religion and politics are bigger games than drugs and guns. The central plot revolves around an honest cop Sartaj Singh (Khan) trying to do his bit despite a corrupt system, a fearsome gangster Ganesh Gaitonde (Siddiqui) with something of a God complex, and a sinister plot that threatens to destroy Mumbai.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 18: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J76wN0TPI4">Sanju</a> purports to give audiences the true story of Sanjay Dutt, told straight by Sanju baba himself, warts and all &ndash; no intermediaries or anonymous sources. Why is the film so superficial then?</p>

<p>In fact, Sanju takes far more cinematic liberties than the disclaimer at the beginning of the movie outlines. It glamourizes his questionable behaviour and glosses over major chunks of his troubled life. So is this a true biopic or wishful thinking on both Sanjay Dutt and Rajkumar Hirani&rsquo;s part?</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 16: In what is likely a Bollywood first, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZODr96ZRCc">Veere Di Wedding</a> brings the story of four childhood female friends to screen. Yes! Girls can have fun, and make a box-office hit too! The film stars Kareena Kapoor Khan, Sonam K. Ahuja, Swara Bhaskar and Shikha Talsania.</p>

<p>While bromances have long been depicted in Bollywood, ranging from an adult friendship in Sholay to childhood friends in Dil Chahta Hai or Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, it is unusual to see meaningful female friendships in Hindi cinema. Which is why Veere Di Wedding is a worthwhile film - featuring women who drink, swear and love with abandon - even if it isn&rsquo;t particularly deep.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 14: Based on a true story, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDbjJVmGV98">Raazi</a> brings an unlikely female spy to the big screen. When Bangladesh sought to secede from Pakistan, India got involved in a military confrontation that came to be known as the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. At the time, a young Kashmiri woman Sehmat Khan married into a Pakistani general&rsquo;s family at the request of her father, who himself was a Kashmiri businessman and spy. Sehmat&rsquo;s role was to provide intelligence to Indian spy agencies. When former Indian Navy officer Harinder S. Sikka found out about the story and tracked down Sehmat Khan, he wrote the book Calling Sehmat. The book became the basis of Raazi, which has been co-written and directed by Meghna Gulzar.</p>

<p>In Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar, Aparita and Baisakhi talk about being inspired by Raazi&rsquo;s soundtrack to remember songs such as the Lata Mangeshkar classic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSJ1MMGi_IQ">Aye Mere Watan Ke Logon</a>, Bombay Velvet&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlgVLKCayfk">Jaata Kahaan Hai Deewane</a> &ndash; which in turn was a reprisal of an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AAPQZNs1sg">O. P.  Nayyar tune</a> from CID, sung by Geeta Dutt.</p>

<p>Filmi Khabrein has information about Dulquer Salmaan&rsquo;s Bollywood debut and Vaani Kapoor joining the Shamshera cast among other news.</p>

<p>In Bollywood Behes, a discussion of Meghna Gulzar&rsquo;s Raazi, starring Alia Bhatt and Vicky Kaushal, and how the Bollywood starlet is helped by an ensemble cast to pull off a complicated role.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 13: Are Luv Ranjan films such as Pyaar Ka Punchnama and Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety misogynistic? Aparita and Baisakhi debate in two episodes. In #13, a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2q64UowX9g">Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety</a>. This movie marks the return of Kartik Aaryan and Nushrat Bharucha along with Sunny Singh Nijjar in yet another Luv Ranjan bromance, this time set against a shaadi ka backdrop.</p>

<p>In Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar listen to Lehmber Hussainpuri&rsquo;s popping track <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POvYNnEWuIo">Sadi Gali</a> from Tanu Weds Manu (2011), and the gentle duet from Abhimaan (1973) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M43y1Hodn2c">Teri Bindiya Re</a>, sung by Mohd. Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar.</p>

<p>Filmi Khabrein has information about the upcoming John Abraham starrer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQFb12N0Arc">Parmanu</a>, along with news about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtvIt-MNSK0">Manto</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmrYQp8JcJM">Sir</a> impressing critics at Cannes festival.</p>

<p>In Bollywood Behes, Aparita and Baisakhi discuss their own interpretations of Luv Ranjan&rsquo;s third feature Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety, which became one of Bollywood&rsquo;s highest grossing films in early 2018. Although a much more polished affair than his debut film, critics pointed out that elements of misogyny continued in Luv Ranjan&rsquo;s latest work.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 12: Are Luv Ranjan films such as Pyaar Ka Punchnama and Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety misogynistic? Aparita and Baisakhi debate &ndash; in two episodes. In #12, a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaD36MRxBw">Pyaar Ka Punchnama</a>. This movie has been described as a battle of the sexes comedy, which made director Luv Ranjan, and actors Kartik Aaryan and Nushrat Bharucha into household names in India.</p>

<p>In Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar we take a cue from the start of shaadi ka season and listen to AR Rahman&rsquo;s track <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTpxYgX6RPU">Mehndi Hai Rachne Wali</a> from Zubeidaa (2001), and another ladies sangeet hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTmF2v59CtI">Sheila Ki Jawani</a>, a Vishal-Shekhar composition from Tees Maar Khan (2010).</p>

<p>Filmi Khabrein has information about upcoming dacoit movies <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT15HtJ5Gsk">Shamshera</a> and Son Chiriya, Madhuri Dixit starring in a Marathi film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlmxohf1i_8">Bucket List</a> and whether Bollywood can also have its #MeToo moment.</p>

<p>In Bollywood Behes, Aparita and Baisakhi discuss their own interpretations of Luv Ranjan&rsquo;s debut feature film Pyaar Ka Punchnama, which turned out to be a sleeper hit and made the director and leading pair into celebrities. While many in the audience, and some critics, praised the film for showcasing the reality of relationships from a male perspective, others have characterized it as a misogynistic film.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 11: A look at <a href="http://www.tungrus.com/">Tungrus</a>, a contemporary Indian documentary, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33CCBkosSBw">Shakespeare Wallah</a>, the Merchant-Ivory classic starring Shashi Kapoor, Felicity Kendal and Madhur Jaffray.</p>

<p>In Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar we listen once again to some golden oldies starring Shashi Kapoor: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBgKPyi1aXA">Khilte Hain Gul Yahan</a> from Sharmilee (1971) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVhIPVDxsPQ">Raat Baaki</a> from Namak Halaal (1982).</p>

<p>Filmi Khabrein has a discussion of the upcoming Bollywood shaadi/wedding extravangza movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZODr96ZRCc">Veere Di Wedding</a>, another quick take on Vikramaditya Motwane’s new film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v19TKDCNT9Y">Bhavesh Joshi</a> and Javed Akhtar calling out &lsquo;creative vandalism.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In Bollywood Behes, we first talk to Rishi Chandna, the director of Tungrus, which played at the <a href="https://www.hotdocs.ca/p">Hot Docs Festival</a>. He talks about finding his passion for films after a short soul-selling stint in the advertising world, finding his voice by editing wedding videos for his friends, and the chance conversation that led to the making of Tungrus.</p>

<p>Then we consider Shakespeare Wallah (1965), which is playing at <a href="http://www.iaac.us/nyiff2018/schedule.htm">NYIFF</a> as part of a Merchant-Ivory retrospective and a tribute to celebrated Indian actor Shashi Kapoor. NYIFF runs from May 7 to 12 in New York. Although now a classic, the story of Shakespeare Wallah revolving around a British theatre troupe that performs Shakespeare plays across India in a post-Independence setting, has renewed relevance today.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 10: Shoojit Sircar’s latest film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vracgLyJwI">October</a> contemplates the journey of Dan (Varun Dhawan) as he comes to appreciate his life while facing his colleague Shiuli’s (Banita Sandhu) brush with death.</p>

<p>A quick round of Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar considers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFNmDyBKqk8">Manmarziyan</a> from Lootera (2013) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHIJmehK5OA">Manwa</a> from October. Filmi Khabrein has a quick discussion of the upcoming Sanjay Dutt bio-pic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRr1qiJRsXk">Sanju</a>, Vikramaditya Motwane’s new film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD-p1rMjJT0">Bhavesh Joshi</a> and the reuniting of a popular Bollywood on-screen pair.</p>

<p>In Bollywood Behes, the conversation centres on October as a reflective film. Aparita Bhandari and Baisakhi Roy debate whether Varun Dhawan, one of Bollywood’s hot new stars, is truly able to get under the skin of the main character Dan; and how writer Juhi Chaturvedi and Shoojit Sircar are crafting a new language in Bollywood films.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 8: Irrfan Khan&rsquo;s latest film Blackmail has been billed as a dark comedy. Early reviews also called it a satire on marriage. Aparita and Baisakhi discuss whether the movie truly lives up to the potential of its premise.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDF1qdUtbzw">Blackmail</a> revolves around the story of Dev (Irrfan Khan) who discovers his wife Reena (Kirti Kulhari) is having an affair and decides to blackmail her lover Ranjit (Arunoday Singh). While Bollywood and other Hindi films often hold up marriage as a sacred institution, the topic of marital infidelity has been explored in movies such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S18p4n6svxA">Silsila</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPM8Jle8s5U">Ijaazat</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9fIHRGZKM0">Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna</a>.</p>

<p>Blackmail&rsquo;s concept held a lot of promise and &ndash; of course &ndash; features the inimitable Irrfan Khan. But does it deliver? Listen to find out!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ_H3RY_NpY">Chashme Badoor</a> is likely the most well-known of Farooq Sheikh&rsquo;s movies. The cult romantic comedy was known for its simple and charming story, which was brilliantly acted by the ensemble cast. But he also starred in many other films including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_kTGSEXJ0c0">Saath Saath</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFuW12ArFo4&amp;t=1185s">Katha</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB3y_BA8ShA">Kissi Se Na Kehna</a>, to name a few.</p>

<p>More recently he was seen in movies such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llcePeE6Js8">Shanghai</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY4xXvvHcdE">Listen Amaya</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUDYZMYqKGc&amp;t=12s">Club 60</a>.</p>

<p>Born on 25 March, Farooq Sheikh would have turned 70 this year. On this anniversary, a reflection on his films and what made him such a memorable actor, including a conversation with Indian Express film critic <a href="http://indianexpress.com/profile/columnist/shubhra-gupta/">Shubhra Gupta</a> on his rare talent.</p>

After a round of Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar and Filmi Khabrein, we discuss how disability has been portrayed in Bollywood films in our main segment Bollywood Behes.</p>

<p>Inspired by the book Front of the Class, and based on the real life story of an American teacher Brad Cohen, Hichki tells the story of a woman passionate about teaching despite the challenges presented by her neurological disorder. This film gives us an opportunity to look at some previous Bollywood movies such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_AhJ997J0k">Sparsh</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KXpQN0f1rk">Koshish</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zy3F0WVDK0">Margarita, With A Straw</a> that similarly centre around characters with disabilities, and question how their stories have been told.</p>

<p>Prosit Roy&rsquo;s debut film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQKu78NnyvU">Pari</a>, starring Anushka Sharma, is Bollywood&rsquo;s latest foray into horror films. However, where previous Bollywood horror movies produced by the likes of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQH62rR30AM">Ramsay Brothers</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXsTxaHmmTo">Ram Gopal Verma</a> depended on sex and jump cut scares, Roy wanted to tread down the same atmospheric horror path as the classic horror film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLpcmEVu9aE">The Shining</a>. Other films mentioned in the podcast include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9AmOMKH7ls">Junoon</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15o0XVPj7tU">Ek Thi Daayan</a>.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 3: In our third episode, we pay tribute to Bollywood icon Sridevi. After a round of Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar dedicated to famous songs featuring Sridevi and Filmi Khabrein, we discuss the Bollywood star&rsquo;s legacy as part of our main segment Bollywood Behes.</p>

<p>The news of Sridevi&rsquo;s death on 24 Feb 2018 left her fans shocked. The Bollywood veteran actress had recently returned to the big screen after a 15 year break, starring in movies such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmGVY4T88dc">English Vinglish</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctApy_i-qg">Mom</a>.</p>

<p>In this special episode, we pay tribute to Sridevi, charting her legacy as a child star in Tamil films, her work in Telugu and other languages, before she reigned over Bollywood in the late 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s. Our friends Sharada Eswar, Suman Gollamudi and Harish Iyer share their memories of the actress.</p>
