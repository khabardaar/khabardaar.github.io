        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 22: Netflix India original series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28j8h0RRov4">Sacred Games</a> has been getting lots of acclaim from critics and audiences alike. Starring Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Saif Ali Khan in main roles, alongside a stellar supporting cast, it is directed by Hindi cinema heavyweights Vikramaditya Motwane and Anurag Kashyap.</p>

<p>Sacred Games is adapted from Vikram Chandra&rsquo;s 2006 novel, a 900-page tome. The series stays true to the spirit of the novel, which takes us into the labyrinthine depths of Mumbai, where religion and politics are bigger games than drugs and guns. The central plot revolves around an honest cop Sartaj Singh (Khan) trying to do his bit despite a corrupt system, a fearsome gangster Ganesh Gaitonde (Siddiqui) with something of a God complex, and a sinister plot that threatens to destroy Mumbai.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 18: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J76wN0TPI4">Sanju</a> purports to give audiences the true story of Sanjay Dutt, told straight by Sanju baba himself, warts and all &ndash; no intermediaries or anonymous sources. Why is the film so superficial then?</p>

<p>In fact, Sanju takes far more cinematic liberties than the disclaimer at the beginning of the movie outlines. It glamourizes his questionable behaviour and glosses over major chunks of his troubled life. So is this a true biopic or wishful thinking on both Sanjay Dutt and Rajkumar Hirani&rsquo;s part?</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 16: In what is likely a Bollywood first, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZODr96ZRCc">Veere Di Wedding</a> brings the story of four childhood female friends to screen. Yes! Girls can have fun, and make a box-office hit too! The film stars Kareena Kapoor Khan, Sonam K. Ahuja, Swara Bhaskar and Shikha Talsania.</p>

<p>While bromances have long been depicted in Bollywood, ranging from an adult friendship in Sholay to childhood friends in Dil Chahta Hai or Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, it is unusual to see meaningful female friendships in Hindi cinema. Which is why Veere Di Wedding is a worthwhile film - featuring women who drink, swear and love with abandon - even if it isn&rsquo;t particularly deep.</p>

        <googleplay:description>Episode 14: Starring Alia Bhatt, Raazi shines a spotlight on the true story of an unlikely female spy.</googleplay:description>
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 14: Based on a true story, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDbjJVmGV98">Raazi</a> brings an unlikely female spy to the big screen. When Bangladesh sought to secede from Pakistan, India got involved in a military confrontation that came to be known as the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. At the time, a young Kashmiri woman Sehmat Khan married into a Pakistani general&rsquo;s family at the request of her father, who himself was a Kashmiri businessman and spy. Sehmat&rsquo;s role was to provide intelligence to Indian spy agencies. When former Indian Navy officer Harinder S. Sikka found out about the story and tracked down Sehmat Khan, he wrote the book Calling Sehmat. The book became the basis of Raazi, which has been co-written and directed by Meghna Gulzar.</p>

<p>In Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar, Aparita and Baisakhi talk about being inspired by Raazi&rsquo;s soundtrack to remember songs such as the Lata Mangeshkar classic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSJ1MMGi_IQ">Aye Mere Watan Ke Logon</a>, Bombay Velvet&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlgVLKCayfk">Jaata Kahaan Hai Deewane</a> &ndash; which in turn was a reprisal of an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AAPQZNs1sg">O. P.  Nayyar tune</a> from CID, sung by Geeta Dutt.</p>

<p>Filmi Khabrein has information about Dulquer Salmaan&rsquo;s Bollywood debut and Vaani Kapoor joining the Shamshera cast among other news.</p>

<p>In Bollywood Behes, a discussion of Meghna Gulzar&rsquo;s Raazi, starring Alia Bhatt and Vicky Kaushal, and how the Bollywood starlet is helped by an ensemble cast to pull off a complicated role.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 13: Are Luv Ranjan films such as Pyaar Ka Punchnama and Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety misogynistic? Aparita and Baisakhi debate in two episodes. In #13, a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2q64UowX9g">Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety</a>. This movie marks the return of Kartik Aaryan and Nushrat Bharucha along with Sunny Singh Nijjar in yet another Luv Ranjan bromance, this time set against a shaadi ka backdrop.</p>

<p>In Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar listen to Lehmber Hussainpuri&rsquo;s popping track <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POvYNnEWuIo">Sadi Gali</a> from Tanu Weds Manu (2011), and the gentle duet from Abhimaan (1973) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M43y1Hodn2c">Teri Bindiya Re</a>, sung by Mohd. Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar.</p>

<p>Filmi Khabrein has information about the upcoming John Abraham starrer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQFb12N0Arc">Parmanu</a>, along with news about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtvIt-MNSK0">Manto</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmrYQp8JcJM">Sir</a> impressing critics at Cannes festival.</p>

<p>In Bollywood Behes, Aparita and Baisakhi discuss their own interpretations of Luv Ranjan&rsquo;s third feature Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety, which became one of Bollywood&rsquo;s highest grossing films in early 2018. Although a much more polished affair than his debut film, critics pointed out that elements of misogyny continued in Luv Ranjan&rsquo;s latest work.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 12: Are Luv Ranjan films such as Pyaar Ka Punchnama and Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety misogynistic? Aparita and Baisakhi debate &ndash; in two episodes. In #12, a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaD36MRxBw">Pyaar Ka Punchnama</a>. This movie has been described as a battle of the sexes comedy, which made director Luv Ranjan, and actors Kartik Aaryan and Nushrat Bharucha into household names in India.</p>

<p>In Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar we take a cue from the start of shaadi ka season and listen to AR Rahman&rsquo;s track <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTpxYgX6RPU">Mehndi Hai Rachne Wali</a> from Zubeidaa (2001), and another ladies sangeet hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTmF2v59CtI">Sheila Ki Jawani</a>, a Vishal-Shekhar composition from Tees Maar Khan (2010).</p>

<p>Filmi Khabrein has information about upcoming dacoit movies <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT15HtJ5Gsk">Shamshera</a> and Son Chiriya, Madhuri Dixit starring in a Marathi film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlmxohf1i_8">Bucket List</a> and whether Bollywood can also have its #MeToo moment.</p>

<p>In Bollywood Behes, Aparita and Baisakhi discuss their own interpretations of Luv Ranjan&rsquo;s debut feature film Pyaar Ka Punchnama, which turned out to be a sleeper hit and made the director and leading pair into celebrities. While many in the audience, and some critics, praised the film for showcasing the reality of relationships from a male perspective, others have characterized it as a misogynistic film.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 11: A look at <a href="http://www.tungrus.com/">Tungrus</a>, a contemporary Indian documentary, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33CCBkosSBw">Shakespeare Wallah</a>, the Merchant-Ivory classic starring Shashi Kapoor, Felicity Kendal and Madhur Jaffray.</p>

<p>In Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar we listen once again to some golden oldies starring Shashi Kapoor: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBgKPyi1aXA">Khilte Hain Gul Yahan</a> from Sharmilee (1971) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVhIPVDxsPQ">Raat Baaki</a> from Namak Halaal (1982).</p>

<p>Filmi Khabrein has a discussion of the upcoming Bollywood shaadi/wedding extravangza movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZODr96ZRCc">Veere Di Wedding</a>, another quick take on Vikramaditya Motwane’s new film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v19TKDCNT9Y">Bhavesh Joshi</a> and Javed Akhtar calling out &lsquo;creative vandalism.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In Bollywood Behes, we first talk to Rishi Chandna, the director of Tungrus, which played at the <a href="https://www.hotdocs.ca/p">Hot Docs Festival</a>. He talks about finding his passion for films after a short soul-selling stint in the advertising world, finding his voice by editing wedding videos for his friends, and the chance conversation that led to the making of Tungrus.</p>

<p>Then we consider Shakespeare Wallah (1965), which is playing at <a href="http://www.iaac.us/nyiff2018/schedule.htm">NYIFF</a> as part of a Merchant-Ivory retrospective and a tribute to celebrated Indian actor Shashi Kapoor. NYIFF runs from May 7 to 12 in New York. Although now a classic, the story of Shakespeare Wallah revolving around a British theatre troupe that performs Shakespeare plays across India in a post-Independence setting, has renewed relevance today.</p>

<p>A quick round of Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar considers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFNmDyBKqk8">Manmarziyan</a> from Lootera (2013) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHIJmehK5OA">Manwa</a> from October. Filmi Khabrein has a quick discussion of the upcoming Sanjay Dutt bio-pic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRr1qiJRsXk">Sanju</a>, Vikramaditya Motwane’s new film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD-p1rMjJT0">Bhavesh Joshi</a> and the reuniting of a popular Bollywood on-screen pair.</p>

<p>In Bollywood Behes, the conversation centres on October as a reflective film. Aparita Bhandari and Baisakhi Roy debate whether Varun Dhawan, one of Bollywood’s hot new stars, is truly able to get under the skin of the main character Dan; and how writer Juhi Chaturvedi and Shoojit Sircar are crafting a new language in Bollywood films.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 8: Irrfan Khan&rsquo;s latest film Blackmail has been billed as a dark comedy. Early reviews also called it a satire on marriage. Aparita and Baisakhi discuss whether the movie truly lives up to the potential of its premise.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDF1qdUtbzw">Blackmail</a> revolves around the story of Dev (Irrfan Khan) who discovers his wife Reena (Kirti Kulhari) is having an affair and decides to blackmail her lover Ranjit (Arunoday Singh). While Bollywood and other Hindi films often hold up marriage as a sacred institution, the topic of marital infidelity has been explored in movies such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S18p4n6svxA">Silsila</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPM8Jle8s5U">Ijaazat</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9fIHRGZKM0">Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna</a>.</p>

<p>Blackmail&rsquo;s concept held a lot of promise and &ndash; of course &ndash; features the inimitable Irrfan Khan. But does it deliver? Listen to find out!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ_H3RY_NpY">Chashme Badoor</a> is likely the most well-known of Farooq Sheikh&rsquo;s movies. The cult romantic comedy was known for its simple and charming story, which was brilliantly acted by the ensemble cast. But he also starred in many other films including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_kTGSEXJ0c0">Saath Saath</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFuW12ArFo4&amp;t=1185s">Katha</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB3y_BA8ShA">Kissi Se Na Kehna</a>, to name a few.</p>

<p>More recently he was seen in movies such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llcePeE6Js8">Shanghai</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY4xXvvHcdE">Listen Amaya</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUDYZMYqKGc&amp;t=12s">Club 60</a>.</p>

<p>Born on 25 March, Farooq Sheikh would have turned 70 this year.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 6: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSaCFlXn-g">Hichki</a> marks the return of Rani Mukherji in the role of a teacher with Tourette Syndrome. After a round of Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar and Filmi Khabrein, we discuss how disability has been portrayed in Bollywood films in our main segment Bollywood Behes.</p>

<p>Inspired by the book Front of the Class, and based on the real life story of an American teacher Brad Cohen, Hichki tells the story of a woman passionate about teaching despite the challenges presented by her neurological disorder. This film gives us an opportunity to look at some previous Bollywood movies such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_AhJ997J0k">Sparsh</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KXpQN0f1rk">Koshish</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zy3F0WVDK0">Margarita, With A Straw</a> that similarly centre around characters with disabilities, and question how their stories have been told.</p>

<p>Prosit Roy&rsquo;s debut film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQKu78NnyvU">Pari</a>, starring Anushka Sharma, is Bollywood&rsquo;s latest foray into horror films. However, where previous Bollywood horror movies produced by the likes of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQH62rR30AM">Ramsay Brothers</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXsTxaHmmTo">Ram Gopal Verma</a> depended on sex and jump cut scares, Roy wanted to tread down the same atmospheric horror path as the classic horror film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLpcmEVu9aE">The Shining</a>.
