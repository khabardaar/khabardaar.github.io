Episode 77: A look at the films of Sushant Singh Rajput. The talented Bollywood actor was found dead at his Mumbai home in June 2020. His death was ruled a suicide by Mumbai Police. He was 34. 

After making his debut in Bollywood with [Kai Po Che](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlz09a-pyPE) (2013), Singh went on to play critically acclaimed roles in films such as [M. S. Dhoni - The Untold Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6L6XqWoS8tw) (2016) and [Chhichhore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsxemFX0a7k) (2019). He was praised for his disarming charm, an affinity for intellectual comversations and ability to disappear into a character without making it a caricature.  

In this episode, we look at three of Singh's films where he held his own weight alongside an ensemble cast: [Shuddh Desi Romance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2Hle83Plpo) (2013), [Detective Byomkesh Bakshy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG--GOpi_0g) (2015) and [Sonchiriya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aejAkKGiimk) (2019).
