Episode 126 Anurag Kashyap would like his latest film to start a conversation. Starring Bobby Deol, Bandar/Monkey in a Cage, looks at a man fighting to prove his innocence when accused of sexual assault. Aparita and Baisakhi got a chance to speak with Kashyap about courting challenging subjects, and Deol about how he learned to become an actor in middle age.
