Episode 129 In making Homebound, based on a NYT opinion piece, director Neeraj Ghaywan was mainly driven by a sense of inquiry and curiosity: How to tell a nuanced story of Dalit lives, and other people living on whatever margins they may have been relegated to. In a (all too short!) conversation with Aparita and Baisakhi, Neeraj talks about his worldview and how he shared that perspective with his leading actors Vishal Jethwa, Ishaan Khatter and Jahnvi Kapoor. We also hear from the rising stars of commercial Hindi cinema about diving into the lives of Chandan, Shoaib and Sudha.
