Episode 59: In this episode, a tribute to Vidya Sinha and the modern Hindi film heroine in [Rajnigandha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTMbCPaVaoo) and [Chhoti Si Baat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYhNmOF8lvo).

We begin with Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar, remembering Salil Chowdhury and his music. In Filmi Khabrein we talk about three leading ladies in Hindi cinema today, and their upcoming projects - Sonam Kapoor, Taapsee Pannu and Jahnvi Kapoor. 

In Bollywood Behes we remember 70's actress Vidya Sinha. The news of her demise last month caught everyone by surprise. Aparita had recently watched Rajnigandha on the big screen in Toronto, and had been reminiscing about Basu Chatterjee's 'middle cinema' with Baisakhi. We look back at the modern heroine as represented by Sinha in movies such as Rajnigandha (1974) and Chhoti Si Baat (1975), whose life seemed to mirror that of the viewer.
