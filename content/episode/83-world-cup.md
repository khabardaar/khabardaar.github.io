Episode 86: We discuss the upcoming Hindi film 83 with Rahul Desai, whose opinions on Indian cinema and cricket are insightful and a delight to read. 

This film about India's historic win of the Cricket World Cup in 1983 will be the biggest film of 2021, says Desai. A lot of expectations are riding on Kabir Khan's ability to craft a compelling narrative, and the actors' ability to bring the dressing room drama to the pitch.
