Episode 17: After Bombay Talkies (2013), four famous Bollywood or Hindi cinema directors - Anurag Kashyap, Zoya Akhtar, Dibakar Banerjee and Karan Johar - come together to make a Netflix special, a four film anthology called Lust Stories.

Anurag Kashyap presents a female questioning of monogamy; Zoya Akhtar puts a spin on two tropes: "friends with benefits" as well as the shaadi-ka-rishta scene; Dibakar Banerjee unpacks an extramarital affair between college-friends; Karan Johar gives new meanings to eating ice-cream.
