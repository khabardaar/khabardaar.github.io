Episode 127 Aparita and Baisakhi were a little out of steam at this festival, and only managed to watch close to 34 films between them. But noted film critic, festival director of New York Indian Film Festival and author Aseem Chhabra kept the pace. In a short window between two film screenings, sitting in the Scotiabank Theatre lounge area, Aseem spoke with Baisakhi and Aparita about the films they watched.
