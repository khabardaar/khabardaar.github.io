In Bollywood Behes, Aparita and Baisakhi discuss their own interpretations of Luv Ranjan's third feature Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety, which became one of Bollywood's highest grossing films in early 2018. Although a much more polished affair than his debut film, critics pointed out that elements of misogyny continued in Luv Ranjan's latest work.
