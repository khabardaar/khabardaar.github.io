Episode 60: Aparita and Baisakhi are at TIFF 2019, and give you an update on films they have watched so far.

We begin with Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar and a quick hit of Filmi Khabrein. In lieu of Bollywood Behes, Aparita and Baisakhi talk about watching films such as [Parasite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isOGD_7hNIY), [Jallikattu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ujh22EXdSM) and [The Sky is Pink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prwUFBsDRLk), as well as Hollywood films such as [Hustlers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDv-TwjQ_o4).
