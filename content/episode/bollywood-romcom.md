Episode 33: We are back to our regular programming! In this episode, inspired by the Netflix hit To All The Boys I Loved Before, Aparita and Baisakhi pick their favourite contemporary Bollywood romcom aimed at young people.

While romance is always an ingredient in popular Hindi films, Bollywood romcoms are a genre unto themselves. Contemporary Hindi cinema has given us plenty of movies to choose from, even if the gender politics remain somewhat problematic. While we now see more self-assured female leads, will Bollywood give us a sensitive male character like Peter Kavinsky? These are all points we consider, after a round of Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar featuring two remix songs and the latest news from the Hindi film industry in Filmi Khabrein.
