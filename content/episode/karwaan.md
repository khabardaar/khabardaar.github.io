Episode 25: [Karwaan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz_6jwUGLGk) is an offbeat addition to Bollywood's genre of road trip movies. Starring Dulquer Salmaan, Irrfan Khan and Mithila Palkar, it follows the unusual friendship that evolves between three seemingly disconnected people.

To please his father, Avinash (Dulquer) keeps working a soulless job, although he'd much rather pursue his passion for photography. An unexpected phone call informs him of his father's death in a bus accident and sets the road trip in motion. Avinash enlists his friend Shaukat (Irrfan), who owns a van, to collect his father's body, and discovers a case of mistaken dead bodies. A series of strange circumstances, full of dark humour, requires them to pick up a third passenger Tanya (Mithila) enroute their final destinations.
