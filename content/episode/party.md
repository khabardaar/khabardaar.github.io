Episode 47: In this episode, a look at Govind Nihalani's cult classic film [Party] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1sQcEWlI2Q), starring an ensemble cast of some the best Indian theatre and art-house actors such as Deepa Sahi, Manohar Singh and Rohini Hattangadi.

The premise of the film is deceptively simple. A celebrated playwright Diwakar Barve (Manohar Singh) has been awarded a prestigious literary award. Socialite Damayanti Rane (Vijaya Mehta) organizes a party to celebrate Barve. A room full of intellectuals soon assemble together, but their conversations mainly centre around a missing poet-turned-activist Amrit (Naseeruddin Shah). Over the evening, the gathering discusses the role of art in society, while pointing out each other's - or their own - hypocrisy.
