Episode 16: In what is likely a Bollywood first, [Veere Di Wedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZODr96ZRCc) brings the story of four childhood female friends to screen. Yes! Girls can have fun, and make a box-office hit too! The film stars Kareena Kapoor Khan, Sonam K. Ahuja, Swara Bhaskar and Shikha Talsania.

While bromances have long been depicted in Bollywood, ranging from an adult friendship in Sholay to childhood friends in Dil Chahta Hai or Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, it is unusual to see meaningful female friendships in Hindi cinema. Which is why Veere Di Wedding is a worthwhile film - featuring women who drink, swear and love with abandon - even if it isn't particularly deep.
