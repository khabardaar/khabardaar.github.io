Episode 90: A look at Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's [Toofan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qalsBNwZds) and Pa. Ranjith's [Sarpatta Parambarai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTTAHt4VlUA).

Which film knocked us out more? Toofan starring Farhan Akhtar saw the Bollywood celebrity trying to play a Mumbai gangster turned boxing star. On the other corner of the ring, Sarpatta Parambarai presented us an intriguing look at the boxing scene in 1970's North Chennai, through the lens of several fascinating characters including Kabilan, played by Aarya.
