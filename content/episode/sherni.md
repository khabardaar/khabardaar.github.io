Episode 88: A look at Amit Masurkar's new film [Sherni](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2wg-11MWFU), starring Vidya Balan.

There was a lot of anticipation around Masurkar's new film Sherni, especially after the success of [Newton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU6zMPFd4UU) (2017) -- which was a satirical look at the election process in a small village in India. 

The trailer also suggested the return of Vidya Balan in a serious, dramatic role -- supported by talented actors such as Brijendra Kala, Vijay Raaz and Sharat Saxena. Was Sherni a roar or a whimper? Listen to find out.
