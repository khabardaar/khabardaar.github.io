Episode 67: At a time when many Indians and those in the diaspora have taken to the streets to protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), we look at Anubhav Sinha's [Article 15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKOJY0cU63E).

We start off with Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar, where we remember Bollywood's version of protest songs. In lieu of Filmi Khabrein, Aparita brings you voices from a Toronto protest against the CAA/NRC legislations. 

Many people have been talking about the Constitution of India and holding up copies of its preamble at protests and in panel discussions. We take a look at the recent Bollywood movie Article 15, which also draws inspiration from the document that guarantees fundamental rights to Indian citizens and those living in India.
