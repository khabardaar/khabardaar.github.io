Episode 9: Starring Sanam Saeed and Aamina Sheikh in leading roles, Asim Abbasi’s debut film [Cake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr96skoXSuM) steps away from the traditional formula of Pakistani films.

Cake tells us the layered story of the Jamali family. Zareen (Aamina Sheikh), the middle child, has had to abandon her baking dreams and take care of aging parents Siraj (Moahmmed Ahmed) and Habiba (Beo Raana Zafar), while younger sister Zara (Sanam Saeed) and older brother Zain (Faris Khalid) pursue their lives in London and New York City respectively. 

In this episode, after a round of Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar featuring a song from Cake and a golden oldie, and some Filmi Khabrein, our Bollywood Behes features a conversation with Asim Abbasi, Sanam Saeed and Aamina Sheikh -- along with a discussion on what sets Cake apart from other Pakistani films.
