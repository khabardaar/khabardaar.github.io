Episode 119: Directed by Roshan Sethi, A Nice Indian Boy stars Karan Soni as Naveen Gavaskar, an Indian-American doctor looking for love. When he meets Jay Kurundkar (Jonathan Groff), he's hesitant to introduce him to his parents Megha (Zarna Garg) and Archit (Harsh Patel). Then there's also his supposedly perfect sister Arundhati (Sunita Mani). 

A Nice Indian Boy tries to tell a complicated story in a traditional romcom format. While Baisakhi found it funny in parts, Aparita appreciated a fresh take on representing South Asian identity.
