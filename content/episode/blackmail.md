Episode 8: Irrfan Khan's latest film Blackmail has been billed as a dark comedy. Early reviews also called it a satire on marriage. Aparita and Baisakhi discuss whether the movie truly lives up to the potential of its premise.

[Blackmail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDF1qdUtbzw) revolves around the story of Dev (Irrfan Khan) who discovers his wife Reena (Kirti Kulhari) is having an affair and decides to blackmail her lover Ranjit (Arunoday Singh). While Bollywood and other Hindi films often hold up marriage as a sacred institution, the topic of marital infidelity has been explored in movies such as [Silsila](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S18p4n6svxA), [Ijaazat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPM8Jle8s5U) and [Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9fIHRGZKM0).

Blackmail's concept held a lot of promise and -- of course -- features the inimitable Irrfan Khan. But does it deliver? Listen to find out!
