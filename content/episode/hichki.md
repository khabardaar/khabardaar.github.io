Episode 6: [Hichki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSaCFlXn-g) marks the return of Rani Mukherji in the role of a teacher with Tourette Syndrome. After a round of Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar and Filmi Khabrein, we discuss how disability has been portrayed in Bollywood films in our main segment Bollywood Behes.

Inspired by the book Front of the Class, and based on the real life story of an American teacher Brad Cohen, Hichki tells the story of a woman passionate about teaching despite the challenges presented by her neurological disorder. This film gives us an opportunity to look at some previous Bollywood movies such as [Sparsh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_AhJ997J0k), [Koshish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KXpQN0f1rk) and [Margarita, With A Straw]  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zy3F0WVDK0) that similarly centre around characters with disabilities, and question how their stories have been told.
