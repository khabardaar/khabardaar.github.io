Episode 7: A special episode on Farooq Sheikh. With Baisakhi Roy away on vacation, Aparita Bhandari looks at the work of the veteran Bollywood actor, beloved by his fans, who died of a heart attack on 28 December 2013.

[Chashme Badoor] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ_H3RY_NpY) is likely the most well-known of Farooq Sheikh's movies. The cult romantic comedy was known for its simple and charming story, which was brilliantly acted by the ensemble cast. But he also starred in many other films including [Saath Saath] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_kTGSEXJ0c0), [Katha] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFuW12ArFo4&t=1185s), and [Kissi Se Na Kehna] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB3y_BA8ShA), to name a few.

More recently he was seen in movies such as [Shanghai] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llcePeE6Js8), [Listen Amaya] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY4xXvvHcdE) and [Club 60] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUDYZMYqKGc&t=12s).

Born on 25 March, Farooq Sheikh would have turned 70 this year. On this anniversary, a reflection on his films and what made him such a memorable actor, including a conversation with Indian Express film critic [Shubhra Gupta] (http://indianexpress.com/profile/columnist/shubhra-gupta/) on his rare talent.
