Episode 24: A look at [Dhadak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIE92mUvSsw), a Hindi film adaptation which launched Bollywood progeny Janhvi Kapoor and Ishaan Khattar, but downplayed the issue of caste raised in the original Marathi film [Sairat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMrMKnoYWwA).

While discussing how Hindi films have depicted caste in the past, we revisit films such as [Sujata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JADVMskzsmA), the 1960 Bimal Roy classic which also went to Cannes; [Ankur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlURxHM0cm4), a debut for Shyam Benegal as director and Shabana Azmi and Anant Nag as actors; and [Newton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU6zMPFd4UU), starring Rajkummar Rao, this film by Amit Masurkar explores the state of Indian democracy today.
