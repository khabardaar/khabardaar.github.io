Episode 54: In this episode, despite our better judgement, a look at [Kabir Singh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiANSSgCuJk). The Hindi remake of the Telugu sleeper hit Arjun Reddy is a bonafide Bollywood blockbuster. We try to understand why this misogynist film has struck a chord with viewers.

We start off with Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar remembering two unique Hindi song takes on the idea of love -- Dil Chahta Hai's "Jaane Kyun" and "Man Kyun Behka" from Utsav.

Filmi Khabrein covers the latest in Bollywood news, including an update on Vicky Kaushal's latest army look.

In Bollywood Behes, we revisit some themes we had already elaborated on while discussing Arjun Reddy. We talk about the difference between self-destructive obsession and love -- no matter how intense. However, the movie has broken box-office records. So what do we take away from it all? Tune in to find out!
