Episode 49: In this episode, we unpack our feelings about [Kalank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4Z_ueeT_XQ), the multi-starrer film featuring Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan, Aditya Roy Kapur, Sonakshi Sinha, Madhuri Dixit and Sanjay Dutt among others.

Set against the backdrop of the Partition of India and Pakistan, Kalank attempts to tell the story of love, betrayal and loss. The elaborate family saga starts with Satya (Sonakshi Sinha), who in the face of imminent death due to a disease, persuades Roop (Alia Bhatt) to marry her husband Dev (Aditya Roy Kapur). Stuck in a loveless marriage, Roop finds herself drawn to Zafar (Varun Dhawan), a blacksmith, who has his own agenda in charming Roop. Turns out that this love quandary is actually the result of an older love story that went awry. How will Roop, Dev and Zafar fare?

We begin the show with Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar featuring two 'kotha' classic songs: Salaam-E-Ishq from Muqaddar Ka Siqander and Tharhe Rahio from Pakeezah. Then we check in with some Filmi Khabrein, where we talk about the upcoming [IFFSA Toronto](https://www.iffsatoronto.com/) among other news items, before diving into Bollywood Behes.
