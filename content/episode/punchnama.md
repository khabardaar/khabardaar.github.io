Episode 12: Are Luv Ranjan films such as Pyaar Ka Punchnama and Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety misogynistic? Aparita and Baisakhi debate -- in two episodes. In #12, a look at [Pyaar Ka Punchnama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaD36MRxBw). This movie has been described as a battle of the sexes comedy, which made director Luv Ranjan, and actors Kartik Aaryan and Nushrat Bharucha into household names in India.

In Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar we take a cue from the start of shaadi ka season and listen to AR Rahman's track [Mehndi Hai Rachne Wali](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTpxYgX6RPU) from Zubeidaa (2001), and another ladies sangeet hit [Sheila Ki Jawani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTmF2v59CtI), a Vishal-Shekhar composition from Tees Maar Khan (2010).

Filmi Khabrein has information about upcoming dacoit movies [Shamshera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT15HtJ5Gsk) and Son Chiriya, Madhuri Dixit starring in a Marathi film [Bucket List](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlmxohf1i_8) and whether Bollywood can also have its #MeToo moment.

In Bollywood Behes, Aparita and Baisakhi discuss their own interpretations of Luv Ranjan's debut feature film Pyaar Ka Punchnama, which turned out to be a sleeper hit and made the director and leading pair into celebrities. While many in the audience, and some critics, praised the film for showcasing the reality of relationships from a male perspective, others have characterized it as a misogynistic film.
