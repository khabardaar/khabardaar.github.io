Episode 55: In this episode, a look at Deepa Mehta's [Netflix series Leila](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yxjRgwYymg). We talk about its origins as a book by journalist-turned-author Prayaag Akbar, and why a dystopian series set in India doesn't seem to be too far from present day reality.

We start off with Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar that features two songs starring Ayushmann Khurrana: Pani Da Rang from Vicky Donor and Moh Moh Ke Dhaage from Dum Laga Ke Haisha.
