Episode 118: Ashim Ahluwalia's biopic on Mumbai's famed gangster-turned-politician Arun Gawli features Arjun Rampal as the main character. Set in the 80's, the film depicts the period and its politics with gritty realism. Aparita and Baisakhi talk about the central role played by Canadian cinematographer Jessica Lee Gagne in visualizing Daddy, and where else you may have seen her work.
