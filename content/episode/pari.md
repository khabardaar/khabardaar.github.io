Episode 4: In our fourth episode, we look at Pari and Bollywood's latest take on the horror film genre. After a round of Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar (The Horror Edition) and Filmi Khabrein, we discuss how Pari fits into the Bollywood horror films tradition as part of our main segment Bollywood Behes. 

Prosit Roy's debut film [Pari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQKu78NnyvU), starring Anushka Sharma, is Bollywood's latest foray into horror films. However, where previous Bollywood horror movies produced by the likes of the [Ramsay Brothers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQH62rR30AM) and [Ram Gopal Verma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXsTxaHmmTo) depended on sex and jump cut scares, Roy wanted to tread down the same atmospheric horror path as the classic horror film [The Shining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLpcmEVu9aE). Other films mentioned in the podcast include [Junoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9AmOMKH7ls) and [Ek Thi Daayan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15o0XVPj7tU).
