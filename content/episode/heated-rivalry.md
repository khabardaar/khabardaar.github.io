Canadian series [Heated Rivalry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKO26odltss) has taken the world by storm. While Baisakhi has been immune to all the spicy conversations about the show centering on two ice hockey rivals, Aparita got curious about why fans are so steamed up. In this episode, Aparita tells Baisakhi about a quintessentially Canadian story -- and they discuss whether it could translate to an Indian medium.
