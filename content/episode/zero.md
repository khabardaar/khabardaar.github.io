Description = "Episode 38: We watched Zero, the big budget Anand L. Rai extravaganza starring Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, alongside top-billing female leads Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif. The movie didn't impress us much; but then neither did Race 3 or Thugs of Hindostan earlier in 2018.  So, this episode features our experience of watching Zero, followed by a discussion on the relevance of Bollywood's Khan triumverate."

Episode 38: We watched Zero, the big budget Anand L. Rai extravaganza starring Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, alongside top-billing female leads Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif. The movie didn't impress us much; but then neither did Race 3 or Thugs of Hindostan earlier in 2018.  So, this episode features our experience of watching Zero, followed by a discussion on the relevance of Bollywood's Khan triumverate.

We start off with Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar, followed by Filmi Khabrein - where we note the passing of two Indian cinema greats: veteran art house filmmaker Mrinal Sen, and Bollywood screenwriter and actor Kader Khan.

We also meet two Shah Rukh fans who run SRK Universe Canada, the Canadian chapter of an international fan forum, and pay a short tribute to Kader Khan.
