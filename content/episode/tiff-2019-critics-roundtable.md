Episode 61: A conversation with India's leading film critics and writers on the South Asian selection and other remarkable films at 2019 Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).

We begin with Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar and a quick hit of Filmi Khabrein. And then we bring you a spirited discussion between [Namrata Joshi](https://twitter.com/Namrata_Joshi), [Aseem Chhabra](https://twitter.com/chhabs) and [Suparna Sharma](https://twitter.com/SuparnaSharma). The talk about the hits and misses at this year's TIFF, the selection of films from India and other parts of South Asia, and some insight into how they manage festival life. (Shout out to [Shubra Gupta](https://twitter.com/shubhragupta), who left this year's TIFF a few days ahead of the team.)

Namrata Joshi is the cinema editor and film critic for The Hindu, and author of [Reel India: Cinema off the Beaten Track](https://www.amazon.in/Reel-India-Cinema-Beaten-Track/dp/9350097214); Suparna Sharma is the film critic for The Asian Age and Deccan Chronicle; and Aseem Chhabra is a film journalist and author of [Priyanka Chopra: The Incredible Story of a Global Bollywood Star](https://www.amazon.com/Priyanka-Chopra-Incredible-Global-Bollywood-ebook/dp/B07F45T42Z).
