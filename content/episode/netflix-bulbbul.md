Episode 79: A look at the Netflix Original film [Bulbbul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGReT9-cAg).

We start off with Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar and Filmi Khabrein.

Then in Bollywood Behes, we look at how Bulbbul takes on patriarchy through the metaphor of a "churail" and other difficult/nasty women.
