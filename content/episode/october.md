Episode 10: Shoojit Sircar’s latest film [October](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vracgLyJwI) contemplates the journey of Dan (Varun Dhawan) as he comes to appreciate his life while facing his colleague Shiuli’s (Banita Sandhu) brush with death.

A quick round of Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar considers [Manmarziyan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFNmDyBKqk8) from Lootera (2013) and [Manwa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHIJmehK5OA) from October. Filmi Khabrein has a quick discussion of the upcoming Sanjay Dutt bio-pic [Sanju](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRr1qiJRsXk), Vikramaditya Motwane’s new film [Bhavesh Joshi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD-p1rMjJT0) and the reuniting of a popular Bollywood on-screen pair.

In Bollywood Behes, the conversation centres on October as a reflective film. Aparita Bhandari and Baisakhi Roy debate whether Varun Dhawan, one of Bollywood’s hot new stars, is truly able to get under the skin of the main character Dan; and how writer Juhi Chaturvedi and Shoojit Sircar are crafting a new language in Bollywood films.
