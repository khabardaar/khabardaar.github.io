After a more or less restful holiday break, Aparita and Baisakhi are back with stories about families. The break over Christmas and New Year's often has us dealing with our loved -- and not-so-loved ones. So there was lots to appreciate in Jar Series' [Perfect Family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poyjubkbB3Q&list=PL4HbYHxQJ5mcZ3_z4o6Rp8X_yeBZunnys) as well as Anusha Rizvi's dramedy [The Great Shamsuddin Family](https://www.hotstar.com/ca/movies/the-great-shamsuddin-family/1271511286), available on Jio Hotstar.
