Episode 53: In this episode, a look at [Luka Chuppi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JLewvWBkCw&t=12s). Starring Kartik Aaryan and Kriti Sanon, this was the latest Hindi film to explore live-in relationships. It's now available to watch on Netflix.

We start off with Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar with a Tamil twist, featuring two AR Rahman songs: Thaiyya Thaiyya and Mental Manadhil.

Filmi Khabrein covers the latest in Bollywood news, including keeping tabs on the #MeToo movement as well as the the critical reception and box-office success of Kabir Singh.

In Bollywood Behes, we discuss whether Luka Chuppi adds anything new to a subject that has already been covered recently in films such as Shuddh Desi Romance, OK Kanmani/OK Jaanu and Befikre.
