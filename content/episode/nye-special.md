Episode 68: To ring in the New Year, Aparita and Baisakhi each choose a film they'd want to re-watch on their TV screens.

We start off with Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar, where we choose two very different songs that we occasionally groove to. In Filmi Khabrein, we look forward to Hindi movies coming out in 2020 - including Chhapaak, Panga and Thappad.

For Bollywood Behes, Aparita and Baisakhi take it easy and pick two films they wouldn't mind watching again while staying in for NYE. Aparita chooses [The Zoya Factor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz9TN7ixPW0), while Baisakhi talks about [War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ0mzXRk-oM). It helps that both movies offer up plenty of eye-candy.
