Episode 27: [Bhavesh Joshi Superhero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v19TKDCNT9Y) is Vikramaditya Motwane's latest feature film, and stars Harshvardhan Kapoor among an ensemble cast of stellar character actors. Inspired by the superhero/vigilante figures from graphic novels, Motwane tells a contemporary tale that also serves as an origin story of a homegrown Indian superhero/vigilante.

It starts off innocently enough. Three friends - Bhavesh, Sikander or Sikku and Rajat - flirt with India's protest culture. But Sikku soon gets disenchanted, and Rajat busy with his job. When Bhavesh's pursuit for 'insaaf' gets him killed, Sikku slowly finds himself taking on a new persona.
