Episode 80: A look at female desire in Bollywood, with a special guest - Suparna Sharma.

We start off with Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar and Filmi Khabrein.

Then in Bollywood Behes, a conversation with noted Indian film critic and editor Suparna Sharma about how Bollywood films have failed to depict expressions of female desire. This discussion was partly inspired by Suparna's [2013 essay on the same subject](https://suparnasharma.wordpress.com/2017/08/17/bhagwan-ke-naam-pe-ek-orgasm-dede-baba-100-years-of-bollywood-and-the-female-orgasm/).
