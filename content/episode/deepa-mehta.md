Episode 120: As part of its 50 year celebrations, TIFF recently presented a retrospective of iconic Canadian filmmaker Deepa Mehta's films. The retrospective included some of her earlier works such as Sam & Me, the Elemental trilogy Fire, Earth and Water, as well as recent works such as Midnight's Children. 

The event gave Baisakhi and Aparita an opportunity to revisit some of Mehta's earlier works, remember their first impressions of both the filmmaker and her craft, and ruminate on how they now approach Mehta's films in hindsight.
