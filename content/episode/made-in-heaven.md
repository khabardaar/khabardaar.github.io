Episode 45: Created by Zoya Akhtar and Reema Kagti, co-written by Alankrita Shrivastava, and co-directed by Nitya Mehra and Prashant Nair, [Made In Heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0UkDQaR5KQ) is an Amazon Prime Video series that uses the backdrop of the 'Big Fat Indian Wedding' to talk about social realities.

First we start off with Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar, a shaadi special featuring some unusual shaadi-waali movies - [Saathiya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZlIWvEmx3s) and [Tanu Weds Manu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc0Kr9JEVXs).  

Then Bollywood Behes takes us into the world of modern day Indian weddings. Dreamed up by Reema Kagti and Zoya Akhtar, this series focuses on the complicated lives of two wedding planners Tara and Karan, and the couples they are planning weddings for. Issues such as dowry, class, tradition, as well as LGBTQ lives are seen through a not-so-rosy lens.
