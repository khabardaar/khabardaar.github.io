Episode 2: In our second episode, after a round of Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar (where we discuss Bollywood songs stuck in our heads) and Filmi Khabrein, we discuss Bollywood’s spy films in our main segment Bollywood Behes. 

Following the release of [Aiyyary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcWXKmnZZVo), Neeraj Pandey’s riff on the famous Adarsh Housing Society scam, we look at the legacy of spy movies in Hindi cinema -- looking at [CID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuCi2uppKww) (1956), [Farz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onO7URuLzzU) (1967), [Ankhen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLz35Cypcng) (1968), [Ek Tha Tiger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmUl0l8qBXw) (2012), [Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Yu_2nyOP5o) (2015) and [Tiger Zinda Hai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePO5M5DE01I) (2017).
