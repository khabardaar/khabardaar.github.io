Episode 36: In this episode, a look at [Stree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzeaGcLLl_A). This horror-comedy film starring Rajkummar Rao, Shraddha Kapoor, Aparshakti Khurrana, Abhishek Banerjee and Pankaj Tripathi was a sleeper hit, telling an unusual story of an evil female spirit who kidnaps men.
