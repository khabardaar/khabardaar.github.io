Episode 48: In this episode, a look at Thiagarajan Kumararaja's sophomore film [Super Deluxe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Xq_Zz3nPA), starring an ensemble cast that includes Vijay Sethupathi, Samantha Akkineni, Fahadh Faasil, Mysskin, Ramya Krishan, Gayathrie and Ashwanth Ashok Kumar.

Super Deluxe features four separate stories (we mistakenly counted three in our discussion, skipping the story of Leela and Arputham) that come together to form a larger narrative questioning issues such as sexuality, religion, caste and gender - while being both deeply philosophical and irreverent.
