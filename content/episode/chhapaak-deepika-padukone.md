Episode 70: A look at [Chhapaak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXVf-KLyybk), Meghna Gulzar's film inspired by acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal and starring Deepika Padukone.

We start off with Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar, where we choose two songs by Gulzar - Meghna's father, celebrated lyricist and erstwhile filmmaker, who also penned the songs for Chhapaak.

For Bollywood Behes, Aparita and Baisakhi talk about their experiences watching Chhapaak. While Aparita appreciated the female solidarity displayed in the film, Baisakhi talked about the ways in which the film reinterprets notions of beauty.
