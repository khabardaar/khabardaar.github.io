Episode 35: In this episode, a look at [Badhaai Ho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unAljCZMQYw), starring Ayushmann Khurrana, Sanya Malhotra, Neena Gupta, Gajraj Rao and Surekha Sikri. Although Hindi films typically centre around its younger stars, Badhaai Ho featured stand-out performances by the senior artists, stealing scene after scene, in a film that broached the topic of parental sex with gentle humour and tons of grace.

All of this after a round of Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar featuring two classic Hindi tunes, and a Filmi Khabrein round-up of the latest Bollywood news. (Yes, we're feeling quite exotic!)
