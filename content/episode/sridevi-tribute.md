Episode 3: In our third episode, we pay tribute to Bollywood icon Sridevi. After a round of Geeton Ka Ghanchakkar dedicated to famous songs featuring Sridevi and Filmi Khabrein, we discuss the Bollywood star's legacy as part of our main segment Bollywood Behes.

The news of Sridevi's death on 24 Feb 2018 left her fans shocked. The Bollywood veteran actress had recently returned to the big screen after a 15 year break, starring in movies such as [English Vinglish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmGVY4T88dc) and [Mom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctApy_i-qg).

In this special episode, we pay tribute to Sridevi, charting her legacy as a child star in Tamil films, her work in Telugu and other languages, before she reigned over Bollywood in the late 80's and 90's. Our friends Sharada Eswar, Suman Gollamudi and Harish Iyer share their memories of the actress.
