Episode 81: And we're back! It's been a few months since Aparita and Baisakhi spoke to each other about Bollywood films. Physical distancing during the time of a global pandemic and other distractions kept us away from our usual Hindi film gupshup. But we're back, with a slightly different version of the podcast.

In this episode, we catch up on films and shows we watched during the time of COVID-19.
