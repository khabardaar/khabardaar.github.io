Episode 97: They returned - IRL! [Aseem Chhabra](https://twitter.com/chhabs), film journalist/festival director of NYIFF, and film critic/writer [Namrata Joshi](https://twitter.com/Namrata_Joshi) attended TIFF 2022. They decided to grace us with their presence at the critics' roundtable, where they were joined by writer, critic and podcaster [Aditya Shrikrishna](https://twitter.com/gradwolf). We missed Shubhra Gupta and Suparna Sharma while talking about films we saw at TIFF 2022.
