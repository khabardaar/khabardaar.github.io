Episode 18: [Sanju](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J76wN0TPI4) purports to give audiences the true story of Sanjay Dutt, told straight by Sanju baba himself, warts and all -- no intermediaries or anonymous sources. Why is the film so superficial then?

In fact, Sanju takes far more cinematic liberties than the disclaimer at the beginning of the movie outlines. It glamourizes his questionable behaviour and glosses over major chunks of his troubled life. So is this a true biopic or wishful thinking on both Sanjay Dutt and Rajkumar Hirani's part?
